        I worked on detecting mirror neuron activity related to grip force in the sensorimotor cortex. Using single-unit activity recorded from an implanted UTAH array, I identified representative neurons that encoded grip force during both action execution and observation, across varying reward conditions. I further developed models to predict grip force based on the activity of these mirror neurons. Notably, my analysis revealed that 1â€“4% of these neurons modulated their response based on reward expectationâ€”a critical insight for advancing the design of reward-adaptive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
      <h3> Project Summary: </h3>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identified mirror-like responses to grip force in both active and observed trials (figure d).</li>
        <li>Decoded force trajectories from neural activity, even during observation.</li>
        <li>Observed reward-based modulation and co-modulation of grip-force tuning (figure b).</li>
        <li>Localization of mirror neurons in sensorimotor cortex (figure c)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Significance:</em> First evidence that MNs encode abstract effort and value in motor and somatosensory cortex, supporting applications in brain-machine interfaces and motor cognition research.</p>
