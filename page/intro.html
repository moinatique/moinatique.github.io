<h1 id="home">Greetings! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Md Moin Uddin Atique, a biomedical engineer with a Ph.D. from the University of Houston, specializing in data science, sensor development, machine learning, statistical analysis, and neuroscience. My expertise lies in algorithm development and biomarker extraction from wearable sensor data. I have developed AI-driven models to analyze complex physiological signals such as Single Unit activity, EMG, ECG, PPG, BCG, Accelerometer and have built scalable data pipelines that integrate multimodal biomedical datasets for end-to-end humanâ€“machine interface systems.</p>
<p>In addition, I have hands-on experience designing deep learning modelsâ€”particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)â€”for image and video processing tasks in computer vision. I am also proficient in cloud-based data analysis, with experience using platforms such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GitHub for collaborative research and development.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked closely with interdisciplinary teams to translate raw biomedical data into actionable insights. My research has been published in multiple domains, and I remain committed to applying data-driven approaches to address meaningful challenges in healthcare.</p>
<p>Above all, I am passionate about the research and development of biomedical systems that improve lives. I am dedicated, hardworking, and always eager to contribute to impactful innovations.</p>
